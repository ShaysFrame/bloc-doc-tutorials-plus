/// TimerEvent
/// Our `TimerBloc` will need to know how to process the following events:

/// `TimerStarted`: informs the TimerBloc that the timer should be started.
/// `TimerPaused`: informs the TimerBloc that the timer should be paused.
/// `TimerResumed`: informs the TimerBloc that the timer should be resumed.
/// `TimerReset`: informs the TimerBloc that the timer should be reset to the original state.
/// `_TimerTicked`: informs the TimerBloc that a tick has occurred and that it needs to update its state accordingly.
